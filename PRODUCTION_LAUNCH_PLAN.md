# IRAAC production launch plan

> **Operational purpose.** This is the shortest safe route from the current
> static website to an operating IRAAC listening platform. It converts
> [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) into ordered work packages that a human, Codex,
> Claude Code or another approved agent can claim and verify. The roadmap
> remains authoritative on product, consent, governance and compliance; this
> file is authoritative on delivery order.

**Plan date:** 1 August 2026

**Target:** begin useful production operation as soon as the release gates pass

**Account assumption:** Rhys will complete every required software sign-up,
billing step, MFA enrollment and access handoff on 1 August 2026; engineering
must therefore begin today against sandbox and synthetic environments

**Production principle:** collecting approved survey responses may launch
before outbound email; email may launch before SMS; human calling may launch
before AI calling. Never hold a safer completed channel for a later, riskier
channel.

## 1. What “production” means

IRAAC reaches production through four independently releasable capabilities:

| Release | Real capability | What remains off |
|---|---|---|
| **P1 — Listen** | Public, mobile-first Have Your Say survey; anonymous by default; optional contact/consent capture; private staff review; audit and withdrawal | All outbound campaigns |
| **P2 — Email** | Approved full-audience newsletter and locked-cohort survey email for eligible pilot contacts; bounces, complaints and unsubscribe work end to end | SMS and outbound calls |
| **P3 — SMS + human phone** | SMS chase and phone-assisted survey for separately eligible contacts; immediate channel/global suppression | AI calls |
| **P4 — AI phone pilot** | Small, consented AI survey-call pilot with immediate disclosure, deterministic survey flow and human handoff | Expansion beyond approved pilot limits |

P1 is the fastest useful production goal. P2 is the fastest outreach goal. P3
and P4 are separate releases because their legal, carrier, safety, speech
quality and operational dependencies are different.

### Indicative critical-path targets

These are planning targets, not promises. They assume the account commitment
above is completed, named human decisions arrive the same business day, and no
vendor, legal, ethics or security gate returns material changes.

| Target window | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Days 0–2 | Owners appointed, accounts opened, legal/governance work started, repository and environments ready |
| Days 3–7 | Synthetic end-to-end slice: sign-in, survey submission, consent receipt, masked staff view and suppression |
| Days 8–12 | P1 release candidate, accessibility/security tests, restore and incident drills |
| Days 13–15 | Small approved P1 production launch and monitored stabilisation |
| Days 16–20 | P2 internal test then small opt-in email pilot, if SES/provider approval and exact-message legal approval exist |
| After stable P2 | P3 SMS/human-phone pilot; P4 AI calling only after its separate proof and approvals |

If a gate takes longer, engineering continues with synthetic data, but no agent
may describe the blocked capability as live or bypass the gate to meet a date.

## 2. Decisions that are already settled for V1

- **Contact groups:** Business Contacts and Citizen Contacts.
- **Monthly operation:** newsletter to 100% of eligible email recipients; an
  independently selected 30% of each contact group becomes one locked survey
  chase cohort; a selected person cannot be selected in the next two calendar
  months.
- **Chase:** direct survey email → SMS to remaining eligible non-completers →
  phone survey for remaining eligible non-completers.
- **Survey:** one stable IRAAC-owned Have Your Say instrument, rendered with
  SurveyJS but governed by an IRAAC TypeScript/Zod contract.
- **Application:** Next.js, React and TypeScript, with Vitest and Playwright.
- **System of record and staff identity:** Supabase Postgres and Supabase Auth
  in `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney), deny-by-default RLS, named invitations and
  mandatory AAL2 MFA. Clerk is the tested fallback, not a second V1 identity
  store.
- **Hosting:** public site remains on Vercel; private app and survey use a
  Sydney-configured execution path subject to the approved data-flow map.
- **Jobs:** Postgres transactional outbox plus Supabase Queues/Cron and a
  Sydney worker; providers do not own eligibility or suppression state.
- **Email:** Amazon SES candidate, initially limited to synthetic/internal and
  explicit opt-in recipients unless AWS and counsel approve the exact Business
  Contacts use case.
- **SMS:** two-way Australian-capable provider bake-off, with Sinch
  MessageMedia and AWS End User Messaging as the shortlisted options.
- **Voice:** Amazon Connect Sydney proof of concept; human calls first; AI
  calls remain a separate opt-in pilot.
- **Delivery:** Codex implements narrow work orders; Claude Code is the
  recommended independent reviewer/test adversary; deterministic CI and named
  humans decide releases.

Changing one of these requires a written architecture decision and named human
approval. Agents must not reopen them opportunistically.

## 3. Websites and accounts Rhys needs

Do not create duplicate organisations or projects. Use an IRAAC-controlled
business email, two named human owners, MFA, least privilege and billing alerts.
Never paste credentials or recovery codes into chat, GitHub or this repository.

### Create or confirm now

| Website | Action | Exact configuration / reason | Owner evidence to record |
|---|---|---|---|
| [GitHub](https://github.com/) | **Confirm existing organisation/repository** | Keep `rhy-collab/iraac-website` for the public site. Create a **private** `iraac-platform` repository for the app, migrations and operational code. Protect `main`; require PR, current approval, checks and resolved conversations. | Two owners, recovery method, branch rules screenshot/URL |
| [Supabase](https://supabase.com/dashboard) | **Create organisation and production project** | Paid production plan; choose the exact **Oceania (Sydney) `ap-southeast-2`** region. Create separate local/test, staging and production environments. Enforce organisation MFA and require app AAL2 for every staff role. | Organisation/project IDs, region evidence, billing cap, two owners, backup policy |
| [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) | **Confirm existing team and create app projects** | Keep the public website project. Add separate survey/admin projects or one deliberately separated app; pin sensitive functions to `syd1`; disable body/PII logging and preview indexing. | Team/project IDs, domain ownership, region/config evidence, two owners |
| [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) | **Create or harden IRAAC account** | Use an organisation-owned account, root MFA, IAM Identity Center, Sydney (`ap-southeast-2`) as the working region, budgets and least-privilege roles. This one account supports SES, KMS, SNS, End User Messaging and Amazon Connect proofs. | Account ID, two break-glass owners, budget alerts, support contacts, region/data map |
| [1Password Business](https://1password.com/business-security) | **Create shared credential vault** | Store recovery material, vendor admin credentials and secret-rotation records. Agents receive environment-scoped secrets through deployment systems, never vault-wide access. | Two recovery owners, vault/access groups, offboarding test |
| [Anthropic / Claude Code](https://claude.ai/) | **Optional but recommended now** | Create an organisation-controlled account for the independent reviewer. Install its GitHub app only on the private platform repo with minimum permissions and trusted manual triggers. Codex can start without it. | Named account owner, app permissions, spending/turn limits |

### Apply inside existing accounts now

| Website | Action | Important dependency |
|---|---|---|
| [Amazon SES](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/) | Verify IRAAC sending domain in Sydney, configure DKIM and a custom MAIL FROM domain, connect bounce/complaint events, then request production access for the truthful approved use case. | AWS says new SES accounts are sandboxed by region and its production request requires a consent and bounce/complaint process. Do not misdescribe directory-derived contacts as explicit opt-ins. |
| [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) | Confirm domain/DNS access; publish provider verification, DKIM, SPF and staged DMARC records without breaking Google Workspace mail. | Preserve the existing Google Workspace records; one owner makes DNS changes and another verifies them. |
| [Google Admin](https://admin.google.com/) | Confirm DKIM is active, create monitored reply/complaint/privacy addresses and restrict admin access with MFA. | IRAAC must monitor replies and opt-outs; sending infrastructure cannot be a no-reply dead end. |
| [ACMA SMS Sender ID Register](https://www.acma.gov.au/sms-sender-id-register) | Confirm ABR contact details and register any branded `IRAAC` sender ID before using it. | Since 1 July 2026, unregistered branded IDs are labelled `Unverified`. The chase should still use a reply-capable number so `STOP` works. |

### Create only when the relevant pilot is approved

| Website | Trigger | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| [Sinch MessageMedia](https://messagemedia.com/au/) | P2 is stable and P3 SMS wording/legal basis is approved | Open a trial/production account and test Australian two-way replies, `STOP`, delivery receipts, webhooks, sender registration, subprocessor locations, support and cost against AWS End User Messaging. Select one; do not run two production suppression sources. |
| [Amazon Connect](https://console.aws.amazon.com/connect/) | Human-phone P3 design is approved | Create the Sydney instance, claim/port a working caller-ID number, request outbound quotas (default campaign concurrency may be zero), configure KMS, queues and human escalation, and prove the exact Australian flow. |
| [Telnyx](https://telnyx.com/sign-up) | P4 voice proof needs a genuine challenger | Time-box an Australian Voice AI bake-off only if Amazon Connect fails a defined latency, speech-quality, locality, handoff or cost threshold. Do not send production data during the comparison. |
| [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/au/) | V1 survey spike fails a mandatory threshold | Request an Australian-region trial/quote for the already-defined comparison. It is a fallback validation exercise, not a second system of record. |

No new CRM, workflow automation, dashboard, analytics or mass-mailing product
is required for V1. GitHub Issues/Projects can track work; Supabase holds
governed state; provider-native telemetry plus IRAAC's audit tables is enough
to start. Every additional SaaS adds identity, data-location, contract and
incident-response work.

## 4. Day-zero human work — run in parallel

Engineering starts immediately with synthetic data, while named humans complete
these launch-critical items:

1. **Name the authorities:** executive sponsor, product owner, Aboriginal and
   Torres Strait Islander data-governance lead/group, privacy/data custodian,
   security incident owner, survey owner, campaign approver and release owner.
2. **Approve the V1 boundary:** adult-only P1; canonical survey questions;
   anonymous-by-default design; optional channel permissions; reports excluded
   from the first release unless separately approved.
3. **Obtain written determinations:** IRAAC entity/ACNC and Privacy Act status;
   research vs consultation/evaluation; Business Contacts data source/licence;
   exact newsletter, chase email, SMS and human/AI call classifications;
   youth exclusion; call recording/transcript decision; NSW and cross-border
   duties.
4. **Approve governance artefacts:** PIA, data-flow/vendor register, retention
   and disposal schedule, role/action/data matrix, small-cell/quotation rules,
   privacy notice, consent text, withdrawal/correction process, incident plan
   and community return-of-results commitment.
5. **Provide controlled inputs:** named staff invitation register with one
   accountable custodian per mailbox; approved business-source sample; domain
   access; brand assets; monitored reply addresses; and pilot test contacts.
6. **Open vendor requests early:** SES domain and production access, SMS sender
   registration, and later Connect phone/quota requests can take longer than
   coding.

These are human decisions. An agent may draft the record, checklist or test,
but cannot supply the authority or legal conclusion.

## 5. Engineering critical path

Each work package produces a demonstrable vertical result. IDs and dependencies
are stable so another agent can take over without re-planning.

### Foundation

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PLAT-001` | Create private platform repo, `AGENTS.md`, ADR template, work-order template, CODEOWNERS, CI and protected environments | GitHub account | PR checks run on a minimal Next.js app; production environment requires named approval |
| `PLAT-002` | Scaffold Next.js/TypeScript app, packages and local Supabase; pin toolchain and lockfile | `PLAT-001` | A new machine can run lint, typecheck, unit tests, production build and local DB from documented commands |
| `PLAT-003` | Define environment/secret contract for local, test, staging and production | `PLAT-001` | No secret is committed; startup fails clearly on missing values; CI and preview use synthetic/test resources only |
| `DATA-001` | Create append-only migrations for identity/contact, answers, consent, suppression, audit and survey releases | `PLAT-002`, approved data boundary | Generated types and schema docs match; migration up/down/restore rehearsal passes on synthetic data |
| `SEC-001` | Implement Supabase named invitations, roles, server session checks, mandatory AAL2 and deny-by-default RLS | `DATA-001` | Anonymous, wrong-role and AAL1 tests are denied; every approved action and data class has an explicit test |

### P1 — Listen

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SURV-001` | Freeze Have Your Say V1 contract, stable IDs, validators, fixtures and semantic hash | Human survey approval, `PLAT-002` | Web, staff and future phone adapters consume one contract; active release is immutable |
| `SURV-002` | Build anonymous mobile survey with rate limit, accessible bot fallback, server-only idempotent submission and no trackers | `SURV-001`, `DATA-001` | Anonymous adult completes without contact details; duplicate submit creates one completion; response tables cannot be read publicly |
| `CONS-001` | Add optional contact details, separate unticked permissions, versioned receipts and no-login withdrawal/preferences | `SURV-002` | Each channel is independently provable; withdrawal and global/channel stops apply immediately and are audit logged |
| `ADMIN-001` | Build invite-only dashboard for masked submissions, consent/suppression timeline, audit log and staff access review | `SEC-001`, `CONS-001` | Least-privilege staff can do only approved actions; shared/generic mailbox cannot become admin without named custodianship |
| `OPS-001` | Add health checks, structured no-PII logs, backup/restore, key rotation, access/offboarding and incident runbooks | `ADMIN-001` | Restore and lost-MFA/offboarding drills pass; high/critical findings are zero |
| `REL-P1` | Accessibility, privacy, security, load and production-release rehearsal | All P1 packages, Phase 0 approvals | WCAG 2.2 AA review, mobile journeys, RLS tests, 10,000-contact synthetic load, PIA and human go/no-go are recorded |

### P2 — Email

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CAMP-001` | Build deterministic eligibility service, audience preview, approval token, immutable manifest and emergency pause | `REL-P1` | Same inputs reproduce the same audience; suppression always wins; no agent can self-approve |
| `SAMP-001` | Implement independent 30% Business/Citizen sampling, three-month rotation and locked combined cohort | `CAMP-001` | Edge cases, shortfalls, deduplication, fairness and Jan→Apr eligibility tests in roadmap pass |
| `MAIL-001` | Build SES adapter, signed/replay-safe events, bounce/complaint handling, RFC 8058 one-click and body unsubscribe | SES sandbox/domain, `CAMP-001` | Synthetic/internal test proves idempotency, immediate suppression, scanner-safe body links and cancellation races |
| `MAIL-002` | Build versioned newsletter and clear survey-chase email approval/preview | Approved exact copy, `MAIL-001`, `SAMP-001` | Human preview matches immutable content and recipient hashes; replies reach monitored IRAAC staff |
| `REL-P2` | Internal seed → small explicit-opt-in pilot → controlled expansion | SES production/provider acceptance, legal/governance approval | Every wave has limits and stop thresholds; no directory-derived send occurs without written provider and legal acceptance |

### P3 — SMS and human phone

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SMS-001` | Provider bake-off and data-flow/contract decision | Stable P2, SMS approval | One provider selected by tested delivery, two-way STOP, webhooks, locality, support and cost; ADR approved |
| `SMS-002` | Add provider adapter, `STOP`/`STOP ALL`, preferences, delivery events and remaining-non-completer transition | `SMS-001` | Stop is immediate and idempotent; email unsubscribe does not silently block separately permitted SMS; global stop blocks all |
| `CALL-001` | Build phone-assisted operator mode against the canonical survey | `REL-P1`, human-call approval | Masked identity, eligibility reason, quiet hours, attempt cap, dispositions, stop interrupt and safety/human escalation pass |
| `REL-P3` | Small approved SMS and human-phone pilot | `SMS-002`, `CALL-001`, sender/number/quota readiness | Every recipient passes live eligibility; complaint/stop and incident drills pass before expansion |

### P4 — AI phone pilot and reporting

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VOICE-001` | Amazon Connect Sydney proof: number, quotas, answer detection, disclosure, canonical survey tools, human transfer, events and data map | Stable human pilot, AI-call approval | Test proves the exact end-to-end Australian flow; no assumed capability remains |
| `VOICE-002` | Deterministic call controller with AI intent assistance, interruption-safe stop, fail-closed quarantine and no persistent recording by default | `VOICE-001` | All approved stop phrases interrupt every state; ambiguous/safety events reach a human; consent and AAL/data boundaries pass |
| `REL-P4` | Small named AI-consented pilot | Community speech/accessibility testing, `VOICE-002` | Immediate IRAAC/AI/purpose disclosure, permission to continue, human alternative, quiet hours, caller ID, return number and stop handling are evidenced |
| `RPT-001` | Reproducible de-identified snapshot and three draft report views | Stable governed response base | Metrics reproduce from locked snapshot; small cells/quotes are suppressed; every publication still requires named human approval |

### R9 — 1800 Mob Link pilot

| ID | Work package | Depends on | Done when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MOB-001` | Public roadmap pointer to the private 1800 Mob Link platform work | R5, platform roadmap | Website docs state the program is proposed, not live, and keep sensitive design in `iraac-platform` |
| `MOB-PUBLIC-001` | Future public information page, only after approval | `REL-MOB-PILOT` in `iraac-platform` | Page explains the approved service, routes crisis needs safely and links to the governed platform without collecting sensitive data in the static site |

## 6. Agent operating contract

Every agent starts by reading, in order:

1. `AGENTS.md` in the private platform repository;
2. this plan;
3. `ROADMAP.md` sections relevant to the claimed work;
4. the current ADRs and work order; and
5. the latest branch, PR, CI and deployment state.

Use one work order and one branch per outcome. A valid work order contains:

```yaml
id: IRAAC-###
title: one reviewable outcome
owner: named human
implementer: codex | claude | human
independent_reviewer: claude | codex | named human
risk: low | medium | high
data_classification: synthetic | operational | personal | sensitive
depends_on: [IRAAC-###]
goal: measurable result
non_goals: explicit exclusions
files: expected areas only
acceptance_tests: [deterministic checks]
human_decisions: [anything an agent cannot approve]
rollback: exact recovery action
evidence: links added before completion
```

Rules:

- Codex and Claude never live-edit the same branch, files or migration.
- Agents use synthetic fixtures and sandbox destinations only. No contact list,
  response, credential or recovery material enters prompts, commits or logs.
- Schema/PII/region/auth/retention/vendor changes require an ADR and human
  design approval before implementation.
- A draft PR opens early. Formatting, lint, types, unit/contract tests, pgTAP
  RLS tests, Playwright mobile/accessibility tests, production build, secret
  scan, dependency scan and migration review must pass on the latest commit.
- Agent review is advisory. A current named human approval and protected branch
  decide merge. Merge never authorises production contact or report release.
- The handoff records commit/PR, decisions, tests, preview evidence, migrations,
  residual risks, rollback and the next unblocked work order.

## 7. Release gates and stop conditions

No real person, business, response or contact detail enters a capability until
its release owner verifies all applicable gates:

- named legal, privacy, research/ethics and Aboriginal data-governance records;
- exact survey/message/script, recipient class, source and channel approval;
- approved vendor/subprocessor/data-location map and contract;
- named staff accounts, AAL2, RLS, access review and offboarding;
- consent provenance and deny-wins suppression tested at every provider race;
- no PII, sensitive answers or raw free text in application, provider, Vercel,
  CI or AI logs;
- backup restore, deletion, incident, complaint, accessibility and emergency
  pause rehearsed;
- domain authentication, reply monitoring, provider events and rate/cost caps;
- synthetic, internal and small-pilot stages completed in order; and
- a signed go/no-go record containing environment, commit, migration, content
  hash, audience hash, rate limit, approver and rollback.

Stop automatically on an unapproved audience/content hash, stale consent,
suppression uncertainty, failed opt-out write, missing provider-event
verification, unknown recipient timezone for calls, threshold breach, data
leakage, unresolved high/critical finding or inability to activate the global
pause. Quarantine for human review; do not “best effort” a contact decision.

## 8. First dashboard Rhys should see

The first useful dashboard is operational, not an analytics showpiece. It shows:

- P1/P2/P3/P4 release state and which human gate blocks the next release;
- current survey release and response count, with no small-cell disclosure;
- staff invitations, named custodian, MFA and last access-review status;
- consent and suppression health, including failed or quarantined writes;
- upcoming campaign preview, exact content/audience hashes and approver;
- sends/completions/stops/bounces/complaints by channel;
- emergency pause, incident owner and last drill; and
- backups, last verified restore and current production commit/migration.

## 9. Immediate next ten actions

1. Rhys completes the full sign-up list today and names two human owners for
   each production platform; agents proceed immediately with sandbox resources.
2. Create the private `iraac-platform` GitHub repository and protect `main`.
3. Create the Supabase production organisation/project in exact Sydney region;
   enable organisation MFA; record the project ID and region evidence.
4. Harden the AWS account, budgets and Identity Center; start SES domain
   verification and truthful production-access request.
5. Name the Phase 0 legal, privacy, data-governance, survey, campaign, security
   and release owners; book the decision sessions.
6. Approve adult-only P1 boundaries and Have Your Say V1, or return a single
   consolidated change list.
7. Codex claims `PLAT-001` and opens the first draft PR; a second agent claims
   review only after CI is running.
8. Build the `PLAT-002` → `DATA-001` → `SEC-001` synthetic vertical slice.
9. Run `SURV-001` → `SURV-002` → `CONS-001` → `ADMIN-001`, demonstrating the
   full anonymous and optional-contact journeys on mobile.
10. Complete `OPS-001` and `REL-P1`; the named release owner makes the first
    production go/no-go decision. Then begin P2 without waiting for P3/P4.
